# JobsPlugin

It is a minecraft jobs plugin. Data is stored in an **sql database**. The plugin was created with the spigot version **1.8.8** and more version of spigot.

# About

The concept of this plugin is very simple. There are **three types of jobs**: Hunter, Miner and Farmer. The player can then gain **experience and levels**, which will allow him to **unlock rewards**. The player cannot "farm" all the jobs at the same time, he must **activate his job** via a command. Each "commit" corresponds to a **new episode**.

# Other 

This plugin was made **during a series of youtube** videos, in which I explain **step by step** how to **achieve this result.** This plugin is **open source** you can use it as you wish, but **don't say you made it.**
